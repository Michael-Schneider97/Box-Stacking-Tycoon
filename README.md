# Box-Stacking-Tycoon
This is a remake of an old school project with newfound knowledge about how to write better code. This readme shall be updated as development progresses. Currently the goal is to create a tycoon game focused on stacking boxes on top of another. It is intended to improve over poor code practices used in the prior implementation of the project, as well as make use of newly learned concepts.
